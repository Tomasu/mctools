potential idea for handling block variants...


use a json based table to map certain data to blockstate keys and values.

like have a matcher for "Block Above Data" and "block data is age" type things. (goldenrail has powered and "shape" , have to check on that, and things like it)

the json data is "compiled" into a table that the blockstate chooser code can interpret as quickly as is possible. hopefully not too much slower than hard coding it
